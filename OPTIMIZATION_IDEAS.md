# Further Optimization Ideas

Here are several ways we can further optimize the application, broken down by the goal of the optimization.

### 1. Improve Backend Speed (Faster Analysis)

The biggest bottleneck is the time it takes for the server to respond. We can make this faster by reducing the work it has to do.

*   **Cache Fragrantica Results:**
    *   **Idea:** Currently, every time we identify a perfume, we scrape the Fragrantica website. We could store the results in a cache. The second time we see the same perfume, we would get the data from our cache instantly instead of scraping the site again.
    *   **Benefit:** This would make repeated identifications much, much faster.
    *   **Implementation:** I would add a simple in-memory cache to the backend.

### 2. Improve Detection Accuracy

We can make the verification logic smarter.

*   **Fuzzy String Matching:**
    *   **Idea:** Right now, we check if the detected name (e.g., "chanel no 5") is *exactly* inside the text read by the OCR. This can fail if the OCR makes a small mistake (e.g., reads "chanel na 5"). We can use a "fuzzy matching" library to see how *similar* the strings are, which is more robust to small errors.
    *   **Benefit:** This would increase the number of successful verifications.
    *   **Implementation:** I would add a library like `thefuzz` to the backend and update the verification logic.

### 3. Improve Frontend Experience (Handling Multiple Perfumes)

*   **Handle Multiple Detections in One Frame:**
    *   **Idea:** The current live view only shows a box for the single best detection. We could update the backend and frontend to handle cases where multiple different perfumes are seen at the same time. The app would draw a box around each one.
    *   **Benefit:** The user could see all recognized perfumes in the camera's view simultaneously.
    *   **Implementation:** This would require changes to both the backend (to process all predictions, not just the top one) and the frontend (to store and draw multiple boxes and handle clicks on each).
