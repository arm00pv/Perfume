# Plan: Implementing All Optimizations

Excellent! I'm excited to implement these optimizations. It will make the app significantly better.

Since this involves three distinct features, I will implement them one by one to ensure each part is working correctly before moving to the next. Here is the plan I will follow:

### Phase 1: Implement Backend Caching
First, I'll add a cache to the backend to speed up the Fragrantica scraping. This will provide the most immediate performance boost.
- **Task:** Modify `backend/app.py` to store the results of a scrape and reuse them for a certain period.
- **Benefit:** Faster response times for previously identified perfumes.

### Phase 2: Implement Fuzzy String Matching
Second, I'll improve the OCR verification by adding fuzzy string matching to better handle small text errors.
- **Task:** Add the `thefuzz` library and update the verification logic in `backend/app.py`.
- **Benefit:** More robust and accurate verification of perfume names.

### Phase 3: Implement Multi-Detection UI
Finally, I'll overhaul the backend and frontend to handle and display multiple detections at once.
- **Task:** This is the most complex step. It involves changing the backend to process all detections and the frontend to draw a box for each and handle clicks on all of them.
- **Benefit:** A more powerful and complete user experience.

I will start with **Phase 1: Backend Caching**. I will create a new, specific plan for this first phase and begin the work once you give the final approval.
