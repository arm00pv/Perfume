# Analysis of the Fragrantica.com Scraper

This is a great question. Here is an analysis of the current scraper's reliability and how it could be modified.

### How it Currently Works

The scraper is designed to be simple and fast. It takes the name of the perfume identified by the AI model (e.g., "dior-sauvage") and performs a search on Fragrantica. It then automatically clicks on the **very first search result** and scrapes the fragrance notes from that page.

### Current Success Rate & Potential Issues

The scraper's success depends on two main things:

1.  **The AI model's output matches Fragrantica's search.** The names you use to label your data in Roboflow (like `dior-sauvage`) need to be search terms that lead to the correct perfume on Fragrantica. As long as this is true, it should work well.

2.  **Fragrantica's website structure does not change.** This is the biggest risk for any web scraper. The scraper looks for specific HTML tags and class names (like `<div class="perfume-card-image">`). If Fragrantica updates their website design, the scraper could break and would need to be updated.

### How it Could be Modified and Improved

There are several ways we could make the scraper more robust and intelligent:

*   **Improve Search Logic:** Instead of blindly taking the first result, we could have the scraper look at the **top 3-5 search results**. It could then use the OCR text we already have to find the best match among those top results. For example, if the OCR reads "Sauvage Elixir", the scraper would intelligently choose the "Elixir" link from the search results, even if it wasn't the first one.

*   **Add a Fallback:** If the scraper fails (for example, if Fragrantica changes their website), we could have it fall back to a Google search. It could search Google for "fragrantica dior sauvage" and try to find the correct link from there.

*   **Use an Official API (if one existed):** The most reliable method would be to use an official API from Fragrantica. Unfortunately, they do not appear to offer a public API for this kind of data, which is why we must rely on scraping.

### Conclusion

The current scraper is **successful** as long as the search term from the AI is accurate and the website's structure remains the same. It can definitely be **modified** to be more intelligent and robust against search result ambiguity and website changes in the future.
